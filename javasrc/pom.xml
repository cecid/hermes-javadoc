			                 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
			             Binary Code License Agreement

			   READ THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY PROVIDED
			   SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS (COLLECTIVELY
			   "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE OPENING THE SOFTWARE
			   MEDIA PACKAGE.  BY OPENING THE SOFTWARE MEDIA
			   PACKAGE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
			   AGREEMENT.  IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE
			   ELECTRONICALLY, INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE
			   TERMS BY SELECTING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON AT THE END
			   OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL
			   THESE TERMS, PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED SOFTWARE
			   TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A REFUND OR, IF THE
			   SOFTWARE IS ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, SELECT THE
			   "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS AGREEMENT.

			   1.  LICENSE TO USE.  Sun grants you a
			   non-exclusive and non-transferable license for the
			   internal use only of the accompanying software and
			   documentation and any error corrections provided
			   by Sun (collectively "Software"), by the number of
			   users and the class of computer hardware for which
			   the corresponding fee has been paid.

			   2.  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is confidential and
			   copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated
			   intellectual property rights is retained by Sun
			   and/or its licensors.  Except as specifically
			   authorized in any Supplemental License Terms, you
			   may not make copies of Software, other than a
			   single copy of Software for archival purposes.
			   Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable
			   law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse
			   engineer Software.  You acknowledge that Software
			   is not designed, licensed or intended for use in
			   the design, construction, operation or maintenance
			   of any nuclear facility.  Sun disclaims any
			   express or implied warranty of fitness for such
			   uses.  No right, title or interest in or to any
			   trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun
			   or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

			   3. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for
			   a period of ninety (90) days from the date of
			   purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt,
			   the media on which Software is furnished (if any)
			   will be free of defects in materials and
			   workmanship under normal use.  Except for the
			   foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your
			   exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
			   this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to
			   replace Software media or refund the fee paid for
			   Software.

			   4.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN
			   THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
			   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY
			   IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
			   PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
			   DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE
			   DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

			   5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT
			   PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
			   LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT
			   OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
			   INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
			   REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT
			   OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
			   SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
			   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will
			   Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort
			   (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the
			   amount paid by you for Software under this
			   Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply
			   even if the above stated warranty fails of its
			   essential purpose.

			   6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective
			   until terminated.  You may terminate this
			   Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of
			   Software.  This Agreement will terminate
			   immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to
			   comply with any provision of this Agreement.  Upon
			   Termination, you must destroy all copies of
			   Software.

			   7. Export Regulations. All Software and technical
			   data delivered under this Agreement are subject to
			   US export control laws and may be subject to
			   export or import regulations in other countries.
			   You agree to comply strictly with all such laws
			   and regulations and acknowledge that you have the
			   responsibility to obtain such licenses to export,
			   re-export, or import as may be required after
			   delivery to you.

			   8.   U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  If
			   Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the
			   U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime
			   contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then
			   the Government's rights in Software and
			   accompanying documentation will be only as set
			   forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance
			   with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for
			   Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with
			   48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
			   acquisitions).

			   9.  Governing Law.  Any action related to this
			   Agreement will be governed by California law and
			   controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law
			   rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

			   10.  Severability. If any provision of this
			   Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
			   Agreement will remain in effect with the provision
			   omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
			   intent of the parties, in which case this
			   Agreement will immediately terminate.

			   11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire
			   agreement between you and Sun relating to its
			   subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
			   contemporaneous oral or written communications,
			   proposals, representations and warranties and
			   prevails over any conflicting or additional terms
			   of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other
			   communication between the parties relating to its
			   subject matter during the term of this Agreement.
			   No modification of this Agreement will be binding,
			   unless in writing and signed by an authorized
			   representative of each party.

			                 JAVA OPTIONAL PACKAGE

			   JAVABEANS(TM) ACTIVATION FRAMEWORK, VERSION 1.0.2
			               SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS

			   These supplemental license terms ("Supplemental
			   Terms") add to or modify the terms of the Binary
			   Code License Agreement (collectively, the
			   "Agreement"). Capitalized terms not defined in
			   these Supplemental Terms shall have the same
			   meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. These
			   Supplemental Terms shall supersede any
			   inconsistent or conflicting terms in the
			   Agreement, or in any license contained within the
			   Software.

			   1. Software Internal Use and Development License
			   Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of
			   this Agreement, including, but not limited to
			   Section 3 (Java(TM) Technology Restrictions) of
			   these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a
			   non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license
			   to reproduce internally and use internally the
			   binary form of the Software, complete and
			   unmodified, for the sole purpose of designing,
			   developing and testing your Java applets and
			   applications ("Programs").

			   2. License to Distribute Software.  In addition to
			   the license granted in Section 1 (Software
			   Internal Use and Development License Grant) of
			   these Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and
			   conditions of this Agreement, including but not
			   limited to, Section 3 (Java Technology
			   Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun
			   grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
			   limited license to reproduce and distribute the
			   Software in binary code form only, provided that
			   you (i) distribute the Software complete and
			   unmodified and only bundled as part of your
			   Programs, (ii) do not distribute additional
			   software intended to replace any component(s) of
			   the Software, (iii) do not remove or alter any
			   proprietary legends or notices contained in the
			   Software, (iv) only distribute the Software
			   subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's
			   interests consistent with the terms contained in
			   this Agreement, and (v) agree to defend and
			   indemnify Sun and its licensors from and against
			   any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement
			   amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys'
			   fees) incurred in connection with any claim,
			   lawsuit or action by any third party that arises
			   or results from the use or distribution of any and
			   all Programs and/or Software.

			   3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not
			   modify the Java Platform Interface ("JPI",
			   identified as classes contained within the "java"
			   package or any subpackages of the "java" package),
			   by creating additional classes within the JPI or
			   otherwise causing the addition to or modification
			   of the classes in the JPI.  In the event that you
			   create an additional class and associated API(s)
			   which (i) extends the functionality of the Java
			   platform, and (ii) is exposed to third party
			   software developers for the purpose of developing
			   additional software which invokes such additional
			   API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate
			   specification for such API for free use by all
			   developers.  You may not create, or authorize your
			   licensees to create additional classes,
			   interfaces, or subpackages that are in any way
			   identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar
			   convention as specified by Sun in any naming
			   convention designation.

			   4. No Support. Sun is under no obligation to
			   support the Software or to provide you with
			   updates or error corrections. You acknowledge that
			   the Software may have defects or deficiencies
			   which cannot or will not be corrected by Sun.

			   5. Trademarks and Logos. You acknowledge and agree
			   as between you and Sun that Sun owns the SUN,
			   SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET trademarks
			   and all SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and
			   iPLANET-related trademarks, service marks, logos
			   and other brand designations ("Sun Marks"), and
			   you agree to comply with the Sun Trademark and
			   Logo Usage Requirements currently located at
			   http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any use
			   you make of the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit.

			   6. Source Code. Software may contain source code
			   that is provided solely for reference purposes
			   pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  Source
			   code may not be redistributed unless expressly
			   provided for in this Agreement.

			   7. Termination for Infringement.  Either party may
			   terminate this Agreement immediately should any
			   Software become, or in either party's opinion be
			   likely to become, the subject of a claim of
			   infringement of any intellectual property right.
