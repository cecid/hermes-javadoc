 * This class is to set the resource(fixture) for the test cases. Especially for the test case that need to simulate the action
 * of file system. Such as test cases for doc processor need to simulate operation of file move. So, before the test cases run.
 * Call the restore method to copy the needed resource to the tmp folder of fixture folder. After the test case finished, delete
 * the temp folder by calling the clean method. The purpose of this restore and clean is to filter the .svn file create by subversion 
 * that is not needed for the test cases to run.
